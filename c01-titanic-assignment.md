*Purpose*: Most datasets have at least a few variables. Part of our task
in analyzing a dataset is to understand trends as they vary across these
different variables. Unless we’re careful and thorough, we can easily
miss these patterns. In this challenge you’ll analyze a dataset with a
small number of categorical variables and try to find differences among
the groups.

*Reading*: (Optional) [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category    | Unsatisfactory                                                                   | Satisfactory                                                               |

*Background*: The RMS Titanic sank on its maiden voyage in 1912; about
67% of its passengers died.

# First Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

**q1** Perform a glimpse of `df_titanic`. What variables are in this
dataset?

``` r
## TASK: Perform a `glimpse` of df_titanic
summary(df_titanic)
```

    ##     Class               Sex                Age              Survived

    ##                                                                             
    ##

    ##  Mean   : 68.78  
    ##  3rd Qu.: 77.00  
    ##  Max.   :670.00

``` r
glimpse(df_titanic)
```

    ## Rows: 32
    ## Columns: 5
    ## $ Class    <chr> "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1…
    ## $ Sex      <chr> "Male", "Male", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Female", "Female"…

**Observations**:

  - List the variables here
      - passenger demographics: class, sex, age, whether survived the
        sinking, and count for each combination

**q2** Skim the [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic,
and look for a total count of passengers. Compare against the total
computed below. Are there any differences? Are those differences large
or small? What might account for those differences?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_titanic %>% summarize(total = sum(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##   total
    ##   <dbl>
    ## 1  2201

**Observations**:

  - Write your observations here
      - Wikipedia says that there were an estimated 2224 passengers and
        crew on the Titanic. This dataset has 2201, which is a
        relatively small difference. The discrepancy could come from the
        data being based on different interpretations of the final
        passenger list, which Wikipedia notes there was some confusion
        around.

**q3** Create a plot showing the count of passengers who *did* survive,
along with aesthetics for `Class` and `Sex`. Document your observations
below.

*Note*: There are many ways to do this.

``` r
## TASK: Visualize counts against `Class` and `Sex`
df_titanic %>% 
  filter(Survived == 'Yes') %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = Class, y = n, fill = Sex))
```

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

  - Write your observations here
      - Other than Crew, 1st class had the greatest number of people
        survive
      - In each passenger class, more female passengers than male
        survived
      - Notably fewer people in 2nd class survived relative to the other
        categories

# Deeper Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Raw counts give us a sense of totals, but they are not as useful for
understanding differences between groups. This is because the
differences we see in counts could be due to either the relative size of
the group OR differences in outcomes for those groups. To make
comparisons between groups, we should also consider *proportions*.\[1\]

The following code computes proportions within each `Class, Sex, Age`
group.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_prop <-
  df_titanic %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex, Age) %>%
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Prop = n / Total
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
df_prop
```

    ## # A tibble: 32 x 7
    ##    Class Sex    Age   Survived     n Total    Prop
    ##    <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr>    <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>
    ##  1 1st   Male   Child No           0     5   0    
    ##  2 2nd   Male   Child No           0    11   0    
    ##  3 3rd   Male   Child No          35    48   0.729
    ##  4 Crew  Male   Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  5 1st   Female Child No           0     1   0    
    ##  6 2nd   Female Child No           0    13   0    
    ##  7 3rd   Female Child No          17    31   0.548
    ##  8 Crew  Female Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  9 1st   Male   Adult No         118   175   0.674
    ## 10 2nd   Male   Adult No         154   168   0.917
    ## # … with 22 more rows

**q4** Replicate your visual from q3, but display `Prop` in place of
`n`. Document your observations, and note any new/different observations
you make in comparison with q3.

``` r
df_prop %>% 
  filter(Survived == 'Yes') %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = Class, y = Prop, fill = Sex))
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (position_stack).

**Observations**:

  - Write your observations here.
      - Proportionally, rate of survival correlates with status with 1st
        Class passengers at the top and crew at the bottom
      - It is still the case that more female than male people survived
        proportionally
      - Even though the numbers indicate that fewer people in 2nd class
        survived relative to the other categories, a much greater
        proportion of people in 2nd class survived relative to 3rd Class
        and Crew
      - Crew had the greatest number of people who survived but the
        smallest proportion

**q5** Create a plot showing the group-proportion of passengers who
*did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class`, `Sex`, *and* `Age`.
Document your observations below.

*Hint*: Don’t forget that you can use `facet_grid` to help consider
additional variables\!

``` r
df_prop %>% 
  filter(Survived == 'Yes') %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = Class, y = Prop, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = Class, y = Prop, fill = Sex)) +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(Age))
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (position_stack).
    
    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (position_stack).

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

  - Write your observations here.
      - A much smaller proportion of children in 3rd Class survived
        relative to the other two passenger classes
      - There were no children on the Crew
      - When children are separated out, it is revealed that the
        proportion of men in 2nd Class who survived is significantly
        smaller than it previously appeared

# Notes

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

\[1\] This is basically the same idea as [Dimensional
Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis); computing
proportions is akin to non-dimensionalizing a quantity.
